This is a port of 9front's version of the Plan 9 program catclock to
Plan 9 from User Space.

This code has only been tested on OpenBSD.

To install, first make sure that you have Plan 9 from User Space (on
OpenBSD, the package is called 'plan9port') installed. Then run:

  9 mk
  doas 9 mk install

catclock needs to run in a Plan 9-like environment, so to execute it:

  9 catclock
